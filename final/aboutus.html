          <h1>Company History</h1>
          <p>After losing jobs at the previous company we worked for in 2008, 2 colleagues and I decided to break into the field of growing fruit and vegetables, using all-natural treatments on one of my friends' farms.

            Our families were the first support we had, and it was precisely through them that they began to learn about our products, which we initially sold right after each harvest. The products went from the field to the sale directly.<br><br>
            
            By June 2009, we already had a large field at our disposal for planting vegetables, and in the farm's barn, we enabled a part of it to install a semi-industrial pulping machine. Already with her, we began to sell and distribute the fruit pulp packed in Zip-loc bags.
            
            Around two months later, we bought a "vacuum" sealing machine with which we could provide a heat-sealed, longer-lasting product, while preserving the protein and nutritional conditions of the product.<br><br>
            
            By the beginning of 2010, we had a lot of machinery at our disposal, and more than 40 people working for our small company. We created several distribution points in different areas of Los Angeles, and some commercial premises where we began to distribute "Fruit Smoothies".
            
            The success has been so great that they have allowed us to create branches in some states of the country, such as Ohio, New York and Texas, as well as in other countries such as Colombia and Argentina.<br><br>
            
            The purpose is to offer customers a drink option that is 100% healthy, where their recipes are original. In addition to these meeting the needs of the consumer, such as the different flavors and prices, so that they are within the reach of each one of them.
            
            For the company to be successful, the owners know in advance that establishing management plans for the company are important, from keeping the inventory stocked, to good service and facilities. For this reason, the products that they handle, such as fruits, are worked on the same farm to take advantage of its proximity in transportation and processing. In addition, this guarantees that they are completely fresh or are refrigerated.<br><br>
            
            Today, there are 70 Bountiful Foods stores across the country,
            to which we recently began with the implementation of shipments from the nearest store to your place of residence through the internet.</p>
